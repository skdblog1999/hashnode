## How To Create An Ubuntu Server In Aws

Hello, everyone, I am *Shashikant* and in this article, I'm going to demonstrate, how you can create your own Linux server in AWS.

If you know what **aws** is then it's good and if you don't know about what aws is then here is a general intro of aws for you.

**AWS** - It is basically a cloud service provider. That provides you a large number of cloud services like computing, storage, database, networking etc online.

Before heading forward there is a pre-requisite that you must have.

So if you have an aws account, then login and open aws console.

## Steps

1. On aws management console search for EC2 and open it.
